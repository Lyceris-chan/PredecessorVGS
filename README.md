# Predecessor VGS
Welcome to the Predecessor VGS repository! This repository contains the tools and instructions you need to get a similar experience to Smite's VGS (Voice Guided System) in Predecessor.

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
Please be aware that the use of this Autohotkey script is not endorsed by Omeda Studios. While it has been stated that using this script should not result in a ban according to information from Epic, it is important to note that the use of third-party software or scripts in games can often be considered a violation of the terms of service and can result in penalties, including a ban from the game. We are not responsible for any actions you take or consequences you may face as a result of using this script.

[This statement is paraphrased](https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/s/question/0D54z00007MNTVkCAP/will-easy-anti-cheat-detect-autohotkey-as-a-cheat-program). The original text from Epic's Games Developer Support Forum stated that after speaking with the team, they agreed that using a macro tool such as AHK would not result in a ban from EAC, as it is not considered cheat software from a technical perspective. If the game's developer allows the use of such tools, then it should not be a problem."

#### Note:
According to Naren, who is the Technical Gameplay Designer at OmedaStudios, it is not their intention to ban players for using the script. However, he stated that he cannot make any official claims about the script's long-term safety, as EOS may change their mind about it in the future without notice. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that using the script will be safe for all eternity.

## Getting started
1. Check the included spreadsheet for the keybindings.
2. Download the files from here.
3. (Optional) Verify the checksum against the ones provided for additional security.
4. Run the EXE or the AHK file. Note that the AHK file requires that you have AutoHotKey installed.
5. With these steps, you should now have a similar experience with the pings as in Smite. Enjoy!

#### Note:
Keep in mind that certain keybinds might open a menu or use an ability if the required key is already being used for another action (e.g. opening the store or the team communication window).

## Stopping the script or executable
To stop the Autohotkey script or executable, you can follow these steps:

1. Click on the arrow at the bottom right of your taskbar.
2. Right-click the Autohotkey logo, which is a green icon with an H in it.
